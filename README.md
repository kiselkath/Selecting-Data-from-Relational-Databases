---
## **Initial Setup SQL**
### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Create Database
(Skip this step in Crunchy Playground‚Äîthey give you a DB automatically. But if you‚Äôre on local Postgres, do this first!)
`CREATE DATABASE hr_services;`
`\c hr_services`
### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Create Tables with Foreign Keys
#### Departments Table
`CREATE TABLE departments (
id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
name TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE
);`

#### Employees Table
`CREATE TABLE employees (
id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
name TEXT NOT NULL,
department_id INT REFERENCES departments(id),
salary NUMERIC NOT NULL
);`

#### Salaries Table

`CREATE TABLE salaries (
id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
employee_id INT REFERENCES employees(id),
amount NUMERIC NOT NULL,
effective_date DATE NOT NULL
);`
### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Create Indexes
`-- B-Tree index on employees.salary
CREATE INDEX idx_employees_salary ON employees (salary);`

`-- Hash index on departments.name
CREATE INDEX idx_departments_name_hash ON departments USING HASH (name);`

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Insert Sample Data
#### Departments

`INSERT INTO departments (name) VALUES
('HR'),
('Engineering'),
('Sales'),
('Marketing');`

#### Employees

`INSERT INTO employees (name, department_id, salary) VALUES
('Alice', 1, 55000),
('Bob', 2, 75000),
('Charlie', 2, 72000),
('Diana', 3, 60000),
('Eve', 1, 58000),
('Frank', 3, 64000),
('Grace', 2, 80000),
('Heidi', 4, 52000),
('Ivan', 4, 54000),
('Judy', 1, 50000);`
#### Salaries

`INSERT INTO salaries (employee_id, amount, effective_date) VALUES
(1, 55000, '2024-01-01'),
(2, 75000, '2024-01-01'),
(3, 72000, '2024-01-01'),
(4, 60000, '2024-01-01'),
(5, 58000, '2024-01-01'),
(6, 64000, '2024-01-01'),
(7, 80000, '2024-01-01'),
(8, 52000, '2024-01-01'),
(9, 54000, '2024-01-01'),
